# Profile Model

## Status

Authoritative for reusable profile selection, applicability, and composition.

## Purpose

A profile is a reusable project category that activates documentation, engineering, validation, and release expectations.

Profiles avoid one universal repository template while keeping concrete project technology and architecture in project-local authority.

Example profiles:

```text
base
dotnet-library
source-generator
cli-tool
blazor-component
artifact-first-runtime
```

A profile defines a broad reusable engineering shape. It may define applicability, documentation layers, engineering blocks, validation expectations, maturity behavior, repository-role behavior, and migration concerns.

## Shared and project-local profile sources

Shared profiles are maintained in this guide repository under `profiles/<id>/`.

A consuming project may define additional **local profiles** under:

```text
.guide/profiles/<id>/PROFILE.md
```

Register only intentionally applied local profiles in `.guide-profile.json` using the reserved ID namespace `local:<id>`. An unprefixed ID refers to a shared profile. The suffix `<id>` is a lower-case kebab-case stable name and maps directly to the corresponding local directory. Local profiles use the same repository/component/surface scope model and additive composition semantics as shared profiles.

Example schema-version-2 entry:

```json
{
  "id": "local:android-ime",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "scopes": [
    { "kind": "component", "ids": ["keyboard-app"] }
  ]
}
```

The local `version` is independently maintained by the project. The guide-system version and shared profile versions follow guide releases. No new metadata property or schema-version bump is needed. `local:<id>` registrations must resolve to a readable matching `PROFILE.md`; missing or ambiguous definitions are planning errors, not silently skipped obligations. Merely finding a local profile on disk does not activate it.

Local profile docs are project-authored planning authority, not copied central guide methodology. They may specify applicability, mandatory and conditional obligations, project-owned decisions, validation/release considerations, and additional capabilities. Their operative conclusions must be represented in project authority or the ready milestone for disconnected implementation.

A project can define a local profile for a concrete platform engineering shape, such as an Android input-method component, when it changes multiple engineering/validation/lifecycle expectations. Being project-owned does not excuse profiles that are merely lists of one-off technology choices.

## Capability and decision vocabulary

Profiles may distinguish:

- **mandatory obligations** — apply whenever the profile applies;
- **conditional obligations** — apply only when the named product capability or consumer surface exists;
- **project-owned decisions / extension points** — require local resolution when material; they are not permission to waive mandatory obligations.

Existing shared profiles are valid without adopting prescribed new headings. Avoid duplicating the same rule across a capability listing and an obligation listing. Project guidance may add planning/review obligations, but cannot silently negate an applicable profile requirement.

## Profiles are not feature tags

Do not create a profile merely for:

- an operating system;
- local versus CI execution;
- one external product or service;
- one packaging mechanism;
- one test-strategy preference;
- one concrete product architecture.

Those concerns should normally be expressed through project engineering policy, validation targets/loci, reusable generic guidance, or project-local specialization.

## Multi-profile composition

A repository may combine a small number of profiles when multiple broad engineering shapes genuinely apply.

Profiles compose additively:

```text
base obligations
+ applicable shared and registered local profile obligations
+ applicable project planning guidance
+ project-local specialization / explicit conflict resolution
= effective project contract
```

Profile order has no semantic meaning. There is no `primary` profile, `secondary` profile, last-profile-wins behavior, or implicit precedence hierarchy.

Avoid profile proliferation that merely reconstructs a project from feature tags.

## Profile applicability

A profile may apply:

```text
repository-wide
component-scoped
surface-scoped
```

Use repository-wide applicability when the engineering shape describes the repository as a whole.

Use component scope when the profile describes one or more durable semantic components in a mixed repository, for example a set of source-generator packages inside a larger .NET package suite.

Use surface scope when the profile applies to a durable consumer/engineering surface that is not naturally identical to one directory or project, for example a compile-time generator consumption surface.

Applicability is semantic rather than path-based. Component and surface identifiers are project-defined identifiers whose meaning must be recoverable from normal project authority such as `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ENGINEERING.md`, or a relevant specification.

Do not make path globs in `.guide-profile.json` the authoritative definition of a component or surface. Paths may change during refactoring while the semantic applicability remains stable.

## `.guide-profile.json` scope metadata

`.guide-profile.json` records profile selection and scope for planning/traceability. It is not ordinary implementation authority.

Guide-profile schema version 2 represents profile applicability with `scopes` entries.

Repository-wide example:

```json
{
  "id": "dotnet-library",
  "version": "0.9.1",
  "scopes": [
    { "kind": "repository" }
  ]
}
```

A first-class command-line product is a reusable product shape rather than merely a packaging mechanism. Use `cli-tool` when the command/process surface itself is supported product behavior.

For example, a .NET global/local tool normally uses:

```text
base + cli-tool
+ project-local distribution specialization: dotnet-tool
```

Do not add `dotnet-library` solely because `dotnet tool` uses a NuGet package as transport. Add it only when a supported reusable library/API surface also exists.

Scoped example:

```json
{
  "id": "source-generator",
  "version": "0.9.1",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "kind": "component",
      "ids": [
        "generator-packages"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported scope kinds are:

- `repository` — applies to the whole repository; `ids` is omitted;
- `component` — applies to one or more project-defined component IDs;
- `surface` — applies to one or more project-defined surface IDs.

A profile may declare multiple scopes when necessary. Do not duplicate profile entries merely to enumerate IDs of the same applicability kind.

Legacy schema-version-1 profile entries without scope metadata are interpreted as repository-wide during migration unless project evidence shows that a narrower scope was intended.

## Planning discovery and implementation boundary

For the affected milestone scope, planning loads the external base/shared profiles, resolves registered `local:<id>` files, reads optional `docs/PROJECT-GUIDANCE.md`, and inspects the relevant project engineering/specification/architecture/decision authority. All applicable mandatory and triggered conditional obligations must be accounted for. Objectives guide planning choices; they do not automatically override explicit requirements.

A new project or planning task may author a local profile if an uncovered engineering shape merits a reusable contract; register it explicitly and resolve project authority before a milestone becomes ready. Do not require a central guide release to introduce a local profile.

Ordinary implementation reads ready milestones and referenced normal project authority; it is not required to recompose guide, profile metadata, local profiles, or project meta-objectives. Planning must preserve the resulting relevant obligations and validation evidence in the handoff.

## Conflict handling

Compatible applicable obligations are combined.

A more specialized profile does not silently override a broader profile. If two applicable profiles impose materially incompatible expectations, planning must resolve the conflict explicitly before implementation proceeds.

The resolution belongs in project-local authority when it affects implementation, validation, packaging, compatibility, or release behavior.

Examples of valid resolution authority include:

```text
docs/ENGINEERING.md
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/specs/<topic>.md
docs/decisions/<decision>.md
```

Do not encode conflict resolution by reordering `appliedProfiles`.

## Mixed-repository example

A .NET package suite containing ordinary runtime libraries and two Roslyn source-generator packages may use:

```text
base                [repository]
dotnet-library       [repository]
source-generator     [component: generator-packages]
```

The `.NET library` obligations continue to apply to the package suite. Source-generator obligations additionally apply to the generator components. Generator-specific packaging or compiler-host behavior is then resolved in project-local engineering authority.

Concrete target integrations such as EF Core, Power BI, SQL Server, browsers, or named vendor runtimes remain project-local specializations unless a vendor-independent reusable engineering shape justifies a future profile.

A concrete distribution choice such as `dotnet tool`, npm, an OS package, or a standalone archive remains project-local specialization even when the reusable `cli-tool` profile applies.

## Promotion boundary

Concrete technology/runtime behavior belongs in project-local authority unless it has matured into reusable guide-level guidance independent of the originating project.

Create a new profile only when the candidate describes a recognizable reusable engineering shape and materially affects several repository concerns such as documentation, validation, packaging, public surface, or release behavior.
